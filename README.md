### 001 - Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something.
I designed a mobile sign up page for Paisano's pizza. I used a fanned our triangular pizza-slice-shape for the background in the second page.

### 002 - Design a credit card checkout form or page.
I redesigned IKEA's sign up page so that it'll look like a deck of shuffling credit cards. This layout lets users go through the checkout process in order, while also letting them look back on the parts they have completed already. I think it would be better if at the end there was a one page summary of the checkout so users don't need to keep going back and forth to double check their details.

### 0003 - Design a landing page.
I redesigned Preciousstar's landing page. The aim was to declutter the landing page and give it a more sophisticated look.
I swapped out some of the info currently on her website to show the main product they sell and put her award and recognition badges on the top left to show off! I think having the badges on the top, instead of at the very bottom, would reflect well on users visiting her site.

### 004 - Design a calculator.
For this challenge I chose to design a calculator for a phone.

### 005 - Design an App Icon.
I made an app icon for a menstrual app that would update to show how many days it was into the user's cycle. The number on the icon is an example that it is 28 days into the cycle.
Depending on the user they can use that number as a guide to estimate or use as a reminder for when their next period is about to start.

I took this inspiration from Apple's calendar app, which shows the day and date on the app from the home screen without having to click into the app to find out.

### 006 - Design a User Profile.
I took some inspiration from recipe apps and dating apps to design an app for foodies to meet up together and rate the restaurants they've been to together.

This app would provide a way to meet new people who like similar foods or who want to try similar new dishes and restaurants. It would also provide a way to see suggested restaurants and user's reviews of their experiences there.

I focused on giving the app a clean look so the pictures that the user's take will look brighter and better on the page.

### 007 - Design a Setting Page.

### 008 - Design a 404 Error Page.
Designing a 404 Error Page for a surf shop. I kept with a simple approach but made sure the navigation bar is clearly visible and have a "Go Back" button available.
