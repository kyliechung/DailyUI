###001 - Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something.
I designed a mobile sign up page for Paisano's pizza. I used a fanned our triangular pizza-slice-shape for the background in the second page.

###002 - Design a credit card checkout form or page.
I redesigned IKEA's sign up page so that it'll look like a deck of shuffling credit cards. This layout lets users go through the checkout process in order, while also letting them look back on the parts they have completed already. I think it would be better if at the end there was a one page summary of the checkout so users don't need to keep going back and forth to double check their details.
