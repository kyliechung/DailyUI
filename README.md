### 001 - Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something.
I designed a mobile sign up page for Paisano's pizza. I used a fanned our triangular pizza-slice-shape for the background in the second page.

### 002 - Design a credit card checkout form or page.
I redesigned IKEA's sign up page so that it'll look like a deck of shuffling credit cards. This layout lets users go through the checkout process in order, while also letting them look back on the parts they have completed already. I think it would be better if at the end there was a one page summary of the checkout so users don't need to keep going back and forth to double check their details.

### 0003 - Design a landing page.
I redesigned Preciousstar's landing page. The aim was to declutter the landing page and give it a more sophisticated look.
I swapped out some of the info currently on her website to show the main product they sell and put her award and recognition badges on the top left to show off! I think having the badges on the top, instead of at the very bottom, would reflect well on users visiting her site.

### 004 - Design a calculator.
For this challenge I chose to design a calculator for a phone.
